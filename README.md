# go-service-skeleton

This repository is a skeleton of a go micro-service. This was made with roughly 3 years experience writing and
maintaining go services. The main idea in mind is to separate infrastructure components from and provide a service that
does not need a lot of maintenance.

### Directories

- [api](api/) api specification for http
- [cmd](cmd/) starting point to run the service
- [configs](configs/) default config
- [internal](internal/) application code
